We were both young when I first saw you.
当我初次遇见你 我们正值青春
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
我轻闭双眸 脑海中回忆开始浮现
I'm standing there
我站在阳台上
On a balcony in summer air.
感受夏季的风吹拂


See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns,
视野里 灯光闪烁 舞会上人们身着礼服
See you make your way through the crowd,
望见你从熙攘人群穿过来
And say, "Hello."
和我打招呼
Little did I know...
对此 我唯独知道


That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
你就是罗密欧 那朝我窗畔抛掷小石子的人
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
可我的父亲却说 离朱丽叶远点
And I was crying on the staircase
我便独坐在楼梯口 黯然抽泣
Begging you, "Please don't go."
我祈求你 不要离我而去
And I said,
并说道


"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
罗密欧 请带我前往唯属于你我二人的地方
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run.
我愿一直等待下去 剩下要做的 只有同你一起逃离
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
你和我也将成为王子与公主那样
It's a love story. baby, just say 'Yes'."
这便是我们的爱情故事 亲爱的 只需答应我便好


So, I sneak out to the garden to see you.
所以我蹑手蹑脚 溜进花园见你
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
我们言行静悄 因为一旦被他们发现 我们就完蛋了
So, close your eyes,

Escape this town for a little while.
暂且义无反顾地逃离这座小城镇
Oh, oh.



'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter.
因为你就是罗密欧 我就是红字中的女主 和你的感情不被认同
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
可我的父亲却说 离朱丽叶远点
But you were everything to me.
但你却是我人生的全部
I was begging you, "Please don't go!"
我祈求你 不要离我而去
